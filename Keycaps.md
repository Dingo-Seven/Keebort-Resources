# Keycaps

This file is not meant to go terribly in-depth about each and every detail about keycaps, but to give a basic TLDR of different aspects of keycaps while pointing you in different directions.

Keycaps are what we use to cover up the backing technologies of the PCB and ultimately interface with the keyboard to enter inputs to the host device. It is one of the most visually striking aspects of the hobby, and is often what drives newbies to explore the hobby.

## Material

The big two materials around keycaps are ABS and PBT. ABS is the material that most folks are familiar with because most OEM keycaps are made of this material. The general consensus is that ABS tends to lend itself to a higher pitch compared to PBT. This is because ABS has a lower density compared to PBT. The key to a more 'full' sound is a proper thickness, ranging from at least 1.3mm to at most 2mm or so according to Cherry specifications.

ABS will develop shine over time as oils and other materials make contact with the keycap when using the keyboard under normal conditions. Sets can look nice when uniformly shined, but that requires time and effort that most folks might not think is worth the trouble. On the other hand, PBT will take much longer to develop shine, but will shine nonetheless.

## Profiles

The most ubiquitous profile among hobbyists today is the Cherry Profile, but there exists many kinds of profiles as shown by [keycaps.info](https://www.keycaps.info/). Do not be afraid to explore other profiles if you have the means to. In my personal experience, I found myself enjoying DSS, MDA, and I look forward to messing around with DCS in the future at some point. Meetups are your best friend :D

Here is a basic list of profiles, in no particular order:

- Cherry
- GMK CYL (Cherry but GMK)
- GMK MTNU
- OEM (Cherry but slightly taller and additional row sculpture)
- Drop DCX
- Drop MT3
- Signature Plastics DSA
- Signature Plastics DSS
- Signature Plastics SA
- Signature Plastics DCS
- Keyreative KAM
- Keyreative KAT
- XDA (I believe XDA Matcha is a rite of passage in this hobby, that's right, Anchor XP)
- MDA
- MOA
- MAO
- ASA (SA but Akko)
- OSA
- KSA

## Manufacturing

Keycaps have a few ways of being manufactured, so I will be providing a brief overview of the most common terms:

- Doubleshot => plastic injection layer for keycap shape, plastic injection layer for keycap legend
  - Legends will not fade over time
- Tripleshot => Same as doubleshot, except a third plastic injection for (typically) a sublegend
- Dye-Sub => Typically entails that a small surface area, or the overall top surface area of the keycap is heated to transfer dye to it
  - Legends fade over a _long_, _long_ time, we're talking 5+ years here if not longer
- Reverse Dye-Sub AKA 5-Side Dye-Sub => Heats all surfaces of the keycap except for the underside to dye the whole keycap
  - Susceptible to warping which can affect stabilized keys like backspace, enter, and spacebar, to name a few of them
  - This also makes the keycaps less thick, which can lend them to a higher pitch compared to conventional dye-sub
- Keyreative Hybrid Doubleshot-Dye-Sub => Injection layer made for keycap legends, Dye-Sub (different colors are possible) is applied to aforementioned layer, plastic injection layer for keycap shape
  - Supposedly a workaround to avoid the problems of Reverse Dye-Sub while also offering color range for different sublegends
