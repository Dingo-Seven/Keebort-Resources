# Keyboards

This file is not meant to go terribly in-depth about the keyboard case/pcb, mods, or maintenance, but to give a basic TLDR of certain processes. The most important aspect of this file is to show some pointers to different useful resources that have been made in the community. I will provide brief thoughts and comments on these resources, but you should go and see them for yourself to form your own opinions.

Keyboards are fairly self-explanatory, but to sum them up, they are an input device that uses different technologies on the PCB to enter inputs to the host device. There exist many kinds of keyboard technologies, Cherry MX is the most popular at the moment, but there also exist Alps, Topre, Buckling Springs, Solenoids, etc.

There also exist many kinds of layouts, starting from full-size 108-key layout, working down to 96% 1800 layout, to 80% Tenkeyless (TKL), to 75% Compact TKL, to 65% compact, to 60%. These are just the most common layouts that you'd find, there's **plenty** more where that came from, including 40s, ergo\_\_\_, planck/preonic, HHKB, etc, to name a few.
