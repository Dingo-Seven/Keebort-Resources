# Cheap Stuff

In general, this is a compilation of links to various cheap things that I think are good deals/examples of what you'd be looking for during your time in the hobby.

I also am looking to include useful resources for folks to use when shopping around to avoid taking too much risk when using platforms like AliExpress and TaoBao.

## Shopping

- Link to [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/e/2PACX-1vTC07f0YZG5CrKL2Z2oo-L09cMz6pnGOsV2Jj1hpLIpBHFAcK9_Pyegcq4LhHK2MOo8WaUYQ_SdYdIn/pubhtml) that documents experiences with AliExpress stores that is maintained by Keybroke's xmex. Currently editing to allow for direct community input through google form/survey inputs.

Here are some AliExpress stores that I have had good experiences with:

- CutesLiving
- KPRepublic
- Keebox
- INEDA Digital Store
